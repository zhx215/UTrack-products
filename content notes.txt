What is contained in this package:

"ERA3.R" is an R code file that processes raw ERA5 datasets to formats of 12 monthly means and 1.0-degree gridded values. It outputs "ERA3.RData".

"UTrack OMS.ipynb" is a Jupyter Notebook Python code file that computes the OMS ratio (“operc”), OMS SST, and OMS RH for both direct OMS and 1st cascading OMS.
The monthly outputs are stored in folders “direct OMS outputs” and “1st cascading OMS outputs”. 

"direct OMS plotting.R" and "direct and 1st cascading OMS plotting.R" are R code files that reproduce the Figures 1 and S3, respectively.

“animation1.gif” and “animation2.gif” are additional animation products for visualization.
“animation1.gif” shows how SST and oceanic RH over oceans and how moisture source regions of “five regions” of Figure 3 change seasonally. The outlines of moisture source regions represent the threshold of 90% precipitationshed area (see Keys et al. 2012, Biogeosciences). 
“animation2.gif” is a zoom-in of seasonal changes in OMS SST and RH For Switzerland area.

UTrack datasets are not available in this package. You may need to download data yourself with the link provided in the original paper (Tuinenburg et al., 2020; Earth Syst. Sci. Data) in order to run "UTrack OMS.ipynb".

ERA5 datasets are not available in this package and are required to run "ERA3.R". However, their outputs have been stored in "ERA3.RData".

You may need to change the codes of file directory in order to read the code inputs and run the codes on your computer.
